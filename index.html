							The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known as the ounce, is a
							felid in the genus Panthera native to the mountain ranges of
							Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
							List because the global population is estimated to number fewer
							than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about
							10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
							following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and
							subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft),
							ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan
							Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the
							northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
							<br /><br />
							Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the
							monotypic genus Uncia. Since phylogenetic studies revealed the
							relationships among Panthera species, it has been considered a
							member of that genus. Two subspecies were described based on
							morphological differences, but genetic differences between the two
							have not been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a monotypic
							species.

						<p>
							Both the Latin name uncia and the English word ounce are derived
							from the Old French once, which was also used for the Eurasian
							lynx (Lynx lynx). Once is thought to have evolved from an earlier
							variant of lynx by false splitting; lonce was interpreted as
							l'once, in which l' is the elided form of the French definite
							article la ('the'), leaving once to be perceived as the animal's
							name.[2] The word panther derives from the classical Latin
							panthēra, itself from the ancient Greek πάνθηρ pánthēr, which was
							used for spotted cats.[3]

							Felis uncia was the scientific name used by Johann Christian
							Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who described a snow leopard based on
							an earlier description by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon,
							assuming that the cat occurred along the Barbary Coast, in Persia,
							East India and China.[4] The genus name Uncia was proposed by John
							Edward Gray in 1854 for Asian cats with a long and thick tail.[5]
							Felis irbis proposed by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1830 was
							a skin of a female snow leopard collected in the Altai Mountains.
							He also clarified that several leopard (P. pardus) skins were
							previously misidentified as snow leopard skins.[6] Felis uncioides
							proposed by Thomas Horsfield in 1855 was a snow leopard skin from
							Nepal in the collection of the Museum of the East India
							Company.[7]
							<br /><br />
							Uncia uncia was used by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1930 when he
							reviewed skins and skulls of Panthera species from Asia. He also
							described morphological differences between snow leopard and
							leopard skins.[8] Panthera baikalensis-romanii proposed by a
							Russian scientist in 2000 was a dark brown snow leopard skin from
							the Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District in southern Transbaikal.[9]<br /><br />
							The snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus
							Uncia.[10] It was subordinated to the genus Panthera based on
							results of phylogenetic studies.[11][12][13][14]<br /><br />
							Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the
							recognition of subspecies. Results of a phylogeographic analysis
							indicate that three subspecies should be recognised:[15]
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>P. u. uncia in the range countries of the Pamir Mountains</li>
							<li>P. u. irbis in Mongolia, and</li>
							<li>P. u. uncioides in the Himalayas and Qinghai.</li>
						</ul>
						This view has been both contested and supported by different
						researchers. [16][17][18][19] <br /><br />
						Additionally, an extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica was
						described in 2022 based on material found in France.[20]

						<h3>Evolution</h3>
						<p>
							Based on phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence sampled across the
							living Felidae, the snow leopard forms a sister group with the
							tiger (P. tigris). Genetic divergence time of this group is
							estimated at 4.62 to 1.82 million years ago.[11][21] The snow
							leopard and the tiger probably diverged between 3.7 to 2.7 million
							years ago.[12] Panthera originates most likely in northern Central
							Asia. Panthera blytheae excavated in western Tibet's Ngari
							Prefecture is the oldest known Panthera species and exhibits skull
							characteristics similar to the snow leopard.[23] <br /><br />

							The mitochondrial genomes of the snow leopard, the leopard and the
							lion (P. leo) are more similar to each other than their nuclear
							genomes, indicating that their ancestors hybridised at some point
							in their evolution.[24]

						<p>
							The snow leopard's fur is whitish to grey with black spots on head
							and neck, with larger rosettes on the back, flanks and bushy tail.
							The belly is whitish. Its eyes are pale green or grey in color.
							Its muzzle is short and its forehead domed. Its nasal cavities are
							large. The fur is thick with hairs between 5 and 12 cm (2.0 and
							4.7 in) long. Its body is stocky, short-legged, and slightly
							smaller than the other cats of the genus Panthera, reaching a
							shoulder height of 56 cm (22 in), and ranging in head to body size
							from 75 to 150 cm (30 to 59 in). Its tail is 80 to 105 cm (31 to
							41 in) long.[25] It weighs between 22 and 55 kg (49 and 121 lb),
							with an occasional large male reaching 75 kg (165 lb), and small
							female of under 25 kg (55 lb). [26] Its canine teeth are 28.6 mm
							(1.13 in) long and are more slender than those of the other
							Panthera species.[27] In relation to the length of its skull and
							width of its palate, it has large nasal openings, which allow for
							increasing the volume of air inhaled with each breath, and at the
							same time for warming and humidifying cold dry air.[28] It is not
							especially adapted to high-altitude hypoxia.[29] <br /><br />

							The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold,
							mountainous environment. Its small rounded ears help to minimize
							heat loss. Its broad paws well distribute the body weight for
							walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase the
							grip on steep and unstable surfaces; it also helps to minimize
							heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to maintain balance in
							the rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and
							is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it
							like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.[30] <br /><br />

							The snow leopard differs from the other Panthera species by a
							shorter muzzle, an elevated forehead, a vertical chin and a less
							developed posterior process of the lower jaw.[8] It cannot roar
							despite its partly ossified hyoid bone, as its 9 mm (0.35 in)
							short vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow.[31][32]
